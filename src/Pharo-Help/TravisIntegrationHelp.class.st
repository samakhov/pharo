		'Travis is a wonderful continuous integration server. Thanks to SmalltalkCI, it can be easily used with any Pharo application. The benefits of using Travis are the following:
		- unit tests are executed at each commit. In case a test is failing, Travis sends you a report by email
		- Each pull request is validated by Travis
		- An application can be built and its tests can be run for a large range of configuration expressed as a matrix

The example used in this help is Roassal3. 

This help has been written as a cheatsheet and does not constitute a complete documentation.'

You would need to create a new ', (self bold: '.smalltalk.ston'), ' file. To follow with our example, we have introduced this file in Step 04. We will now define a new file, called ', (self bold: '.smalltalk_pharo9.ston'), ' with the following content:

The principal difference between this file and ', (self bold: '.smalltalk.ston'), ' is the ', (self bold: '#load : [ ''Core'', ''Tests'' ]'),

The instruction #preLoading: is useful to execute a Pharo script _before_ installing the baseline. In the case of Roassal3, we use preLoading to actually remove some packages to not interfer with the loading of Roassal3. If you are curious, you can have a look at this script ', (self url: 'https://github.com/ObjectProfile/Roassal3/blob/master/scripts/preLoading.st'),

'

In general, you will probably not need a preLoading instruction. You can follow the template:

-=-=-=-=-=
SmalltalkCISpec {
  #loading : [
    SCIMetacelloLoadSpec {
      #baseline : ''YOURBASELINEPREFIX'',
      #directory : ''FOLDERWHERESOURCEISCONTAINED'', 
      #platforms : [ #pharo ]

This simple files indicates that the test of your application will be run over a matrix (osx, linux) X (Pharo64-8.0, Pharo64-9.0).

Travis will begin the build after you have committed and pushed the .travis.yml and .smalltalk.ston files in your repository.
